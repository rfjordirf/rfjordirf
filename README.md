## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jordi, currently a junior web developer passionate about learning and building. I recently finished a fullstack bootcamp and have been coding non-stop ever since.

- ðŸ”­ Currently working with MySQL, React, Node.js, Vite, Angular, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to create clean, user-friendly projects  
- ðŸŒ± Exploring Angular, TypeScript, Three.js, and other technologies on my own to broaden my skill set  
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on frontend, backend, or fullstack projects to keep growing and improving  
- ðŸ¤” Eager to learn from experienced developers and tackle real-world challenges  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development, JavaScript, or my journey into coding  
- ðŸ“« Reach me at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-roig%C3%A9-fuentes-259393209/  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love diving deep into code â€” I can spend 15+ hours a day on screen when Iâ€™m passionate about something

---

Iâ€™m curious, detail-oriented, and driven to improve every day.  
I especially enjoy developing ideas that have real business impact.

So far, Iâ€™ve worked on two small projects during the bootcamp:  
- **Pokemon Visualizer**: a tool to explore Pokemon stats and details.  
- **SkillAgora**: a platform for offering services and hiring freelancers.

After gaining these skills, Iâ€™m now working on my own idea in the music industryâ€”a social network targeting a totally overlooked niche (top secret! ðŸ¤«).

Looking forward to joining a team where I can contribute and keep pushing my limits! ðŸš€
